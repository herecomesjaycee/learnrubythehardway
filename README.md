# Learn Ruby The Hard Way

Learning "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" as a part of the Maker's Academy Precourse week 2 preparation.

I intend to finish at least 40 exercises by end of December 2016.

The reason I am using this resources to solidify my basic knowledge of Ruby because I am a fan of the Learning [Programming Language] The Hard Way format, and it was recommended to me by my peers.
